  By day, I optimize industrial processes and lead quality improvements at major renewable 
  projects. By night, I explore the intersection of engineering and analytics.
  
  Currently fascinated by how traditional industries can leverage modern data science - 
  from predictive maintenance to quality optimization. 
  My repositories showcase projects spanning industry related analysis and explorations in renewable energy data.
  
  Always learning. Open to collaborations on projects that bridge 
  engineering fundamentals with cutting-edge analytics.
